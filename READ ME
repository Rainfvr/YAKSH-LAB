Directions for running pipeline: 

Make sure all your files are ready to be analyzed and contain only 1 image stack per file (they can be lifs or tifs) 

Locate the folder containing your files

right click and select open in terminal 

type "pwd" and press ENTER to print the working directory 

ctrl + ENTER to copy the folder directory



1.) Double Click MH_Pipeline step 1 and paste the folder directory and hit ENTER
2.) Double Click the MH_Pipeline_STEP2.ijm macro and select the folder directory 
3.) Double click STEP 3 and paste the folder directory

now you should have all your data in the project folder put together into 3 .csv sheets that you can go have fun with 
there should also be a spread sheet with all three combined but IDK if it worked the last time I tried and didnt trouble shoot it so who knows!!!
